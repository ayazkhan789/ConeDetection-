Formula Student Driverless / FSAE is an international design competition, where students design and build full-scale formula style racecars. In 2017, Formula Student Germany introduced a new driverless class challenging the students to equip their cars with additional sensors and compute hardware to enable autonomous racing. Henceforth, other events have adapted the driverless class and the self-driving racecars are quickly closing the gap to human drivers.
